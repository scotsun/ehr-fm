/*
Curated: Events Merged

Functions:
1. Merge 4 types of events (DX + PR + LAB + MED)
2. Calculate time offset (hours since admission)
3. Global time sorting (ETHOS key feature)

ETHOS Strategy:
- All events sorted by actual occurrence time
- No grouping by type
- Preserve time information for subsequent TIME_BIN insertion

Output:
- Each row = one event (diagnosis/procedure/lab/medication)
- Sorted by subject_id, visit_seq, time
- Includes time_offset_hours for TIME_BIN generation
*/

-- Step 1: Merge all events
with all_events as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_diagnoses') }}
    union all
    select * from {{ ref('stg_procedures') }}
    union all
    select * from {{ ref('stg_labs') }}
    union all
    select * from {{ ref('stg_medications') }}
),

-- Step 2: Join admission info and calculate time offset
events_with_time as (
    select 
        a.subject_id,
        a.hadm_id,
        a.admittime,
        a.visit_seq,
        a.days_since_prior_admission,
        e.code,
        e.code_type,
        e.event_time,
        e.seq_num,
        
        -- Calculate time offset (hours)
        -- Strategy: diagnoses have no time, place at front (-0.001 hours)
        case 
            when e.event_time is null then -0.001
            else extract(epoch from (e.event_time - a.admittime)) / 3600.0
        end as time_offset_hours
        
    from {{ ref('stg_admissions') }} a
    join all_events e on a.hadm_id = e.hadm_id
),

-- Step 3: Global time sorting and renumbering
events_sorted as (
    select 
        *,
        -- Global sequence (sorted by time)
        row_number() over (
            partition by subject_id, hadm_id 
            order by 
                time_offset_hours,  -- First by time
                seq_num,            -- Then by seq_num (for diagnoses/procedures priority)
                code                -- Finally by code (deterministic for same time/seq_num)
        ) as event_seq
    from events_with_time
)

-- Final output
select 
    subject_id,
    hadm_id,
    admittime,
    visit_seq,
    days_since_prior_admission,  -- relative time
    code,
    code_type,
    event_time,
    time_offset_hours,
    event_seq
from events_sorted
order by 
    subject_id, 
    visit_seq, 
    event_seq
